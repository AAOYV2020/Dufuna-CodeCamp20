My name is Cherish Ebojudah.
At the end of this internship, I hope to be able to boldly say I'm a front end developer without feeling inadequate.
I know that I still have a long way to go and one of the beauties of being a developer is that learning never stops, 
but I earnestly hope that by the end of this CodeCamp,
the constant feeling of being overwhelmed by the vastness of what I'm yet to know will be drastically reduced,
and I will be able to start and finish projects, build web applications and provide practical solutions to real life problems with code.

And more importantly, get my first developer job!
