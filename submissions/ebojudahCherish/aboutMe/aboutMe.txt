At the end of the Dufuna Codecamp I hope to be able to start and finish a project.
I hope to have the know-how to handle small projects on my own and collaborate on big ones, to be able to provide solutions to real everyday problems.
I hope to have the confidence that comes with knowing what you're doing.

And more importantly, I hope to land my first developer job!
